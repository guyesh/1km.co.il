## Welcome to 1km

The original goal of 1 Kilometer was to provide a solution to help find local protests during Israel's 2nd lockdown, which limited the protesting radius to 1km from your home.  
Since then the project grew bigger, and now our goal is to serve as the virual homepage for the protest movement in Israel. 

**Want to help?** Check out our [up for grabs](https://github.com/guytepper/1km.co.il/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22up+for+grabs%22) list, fork the repo and submit a PR!  
We welcome anyone, and would appreciate any help.
